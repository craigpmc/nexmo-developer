## Overview
The Lex connector is a middleware component which sits between the [Nexmo Voice API Websocket](https://developer.nexmo.com/voice/voice-api/guides/websockets) and [Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/), it allows you to connect a call directly to a Lex bot, all audio from that call will then be sent to Lex and responses played back into the call. You pass the details of the Lex bot endpoint and AWS credentials to Nexmo through the NCCO Connect action.
The connector is supplied as an open source project written in python and also has a hosted service on Nexmo in Developer Preview.
